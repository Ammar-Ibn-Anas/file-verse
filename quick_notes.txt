Just some quick notes for myself:

Thinking about the document,
the layout the sizes and memory etc.

Changed the default.uconf a bit.

Also thought about how the default.uconf or any uconf will affect the omni file.

Creating the nessecary folders + cmake file and other files.

Creating the uconf parser which handles the default and any errors that may occur.

Thinking about the logging method and the errors/exception catcher.
