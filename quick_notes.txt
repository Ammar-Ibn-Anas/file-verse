Just some quick notes for myself:

Thinking about the document, the layout the sizes and memory etc.

Changed the default.uconf a bit.

Also thought about how the default.uconf or any uconf will affect the omni file.

Creating the nessecary folders + cmake file and other files.

Creating the uconf parser which handles the default and any errors that may occur.

Thinking about the logging method and the errors/exception catcher.

Made the uconf_parser_test and now am testing it and figuring out edge cases etc.

Now first making the logging / error system before moving on.

Making the logger.hpp and logger.cpp

Standardizing files naming conventions 

Creating log macros etc.

Removing the cmakes sticking to terminal compiling for now.

Chaning the folder and files layout.
